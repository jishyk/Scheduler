# Scheduler

## Added code
The goal here was to make the Scheduler save all my documented assignments or things to get done that day. 
When pressing the save button on the right of the time of day you will be able to save your written schedule. 
The Date at the top will change everyday, along with the written schedule. 
I have the Past, Present, and Future colors in the scheduler to show more important times in the day.
